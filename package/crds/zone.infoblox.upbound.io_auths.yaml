                  The same fields are also added to the terraform ignore_changes hook, to
                  avoid updating them after creation. This is useful for fields that are
                  required on creation, but we do not desire to update them after creation,
                  for example because of an external controller is managing them, like an
                  autoscaler.

                  Secret to which any connection details for this managed resource should
                  be written. Connection details frequently include the endpoint, username,

                  and connection details would be published to both without affecting
